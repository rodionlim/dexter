# Integration Tests

To run the integration tests for the Dexter agent, use the following command:

```bash
pytest -v -s --run-integration tests/integration/yfinance/agent/test_stanley_druckenmiller.py
```

The `--run-integration` flag is required to execute tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`.
The `-s` flag allows you to see the standard output (print statements), which is useful for inspecting the JSON analysis results.
